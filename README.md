# Diabetes Prediction Based on Symptoms

This project predicts diabetes based on symptoms provided by the user. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze the input and suggest possible diabetic condition.

## Overview
This project applies machine learning to predict diabetes from symptoms entered by the user. It serves as a tool for preliminary diagnosis and promotes proactive health management.

## Features
- Input multiple symptoms and predict diabetes.
- Provides detailed metrics for model performance.
- Scalable to include additional symptoms.

## Technologies Used
- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Libraries:*
  - *pandas:* For handling and manipulating the data.
  - *numpy:* For numerical operations and data manipulation.
  - *sklearn:* For implementing machine learning models:
    - *StandardScaler:* For feature scaling.
    - *train_test_split:* To split the data into training and testing sets.
    - *svm (Support Vector Machine):* For building the predictive model.
    - *accuracy_score:* For evaluating the performance of the model.
