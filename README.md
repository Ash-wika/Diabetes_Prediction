## Overview:
Healthcare is a critical domain where early detection of diseases can save lives. This project uses machine learning to analyze symptoms and predict possible diseases. It can be used as a preliminary diagnostic tool to help individuals seek appropriate medical attention.

## Technologies Used:
  Programming Language: Python
  Libraries:
    Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing
    Scikit-learn for machine learning and evaluation
    train_test_split for splitting data into training and testing sets
    LabelEncoder for encoding categorical symptom variables
    RandomForestClassifier for building the prediction model
    classification_report for performance evaluation
