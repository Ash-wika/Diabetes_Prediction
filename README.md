# Disease Prediction Based on Symptoms

This project predicts potential diseases based on symptoms provided by the user. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze the input and suggest possible health conditions, encouraging early diagnosis and medical consultation.

## Overview
This project applies machine learning to predict diseases from symptoms entered by the user. It serves as a tool for preliminary diagnosis and promotes proactive health management.

## Features
- Input multiple symptoms and predict possible diseases.
- Provides detailed metrics for model performance.
- Scalable to include additional symptoms and diseases.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data handling and manipulation.
  - `sklearn` for machine learning:
    - `train_test_split` for splitting data into training and testing sets.
    - `LabelEncoder` for encoding categorical symptom variables.
    - `RandomForestClassifier` for building the prediction model.
    - `classification_report` for evaluating model performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction.git
